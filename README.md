# Rewardhub

## Overview

Reward hub is a web-based platform with mobile applications that help companies reward their employees effectively and efficiently. This project uses JS (node js, express js), css, react and more to provide an engaging and interactive user experience.

Organizations that use RewardHub make their employees feel special, as they gain access to exclusive offers from various vendors.

Organizations can reward high-performing employees with points or grant points on special occasions, such as weddings or the birth of a child. Employees can then use these points to purchase offers from vendors.

## Features

* Enhanced Security: Implemented JWT-based authentication, role-based authorization, and encryption for Passwords.
* Scalability: Designed to handle big volumes of users, transactions, and offers.
* Seamless Reward Distribution: Organizations can allocate reward points to employees based on performance and milestones.
* User-Friendly UI: Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, ensuring an intuitive experience across web and mobile applications.
